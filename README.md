Career Analysis of Cristiano Ronaldo

# Project Overview

This project uses Python and data analysis techniques to perform a detailed career analysis of Cristiano Ronaldo, one of football's greatest players. The study highlights trends in his performance, identifies career milestones, and uncovers insights into his consistent, peak, and challenging periods.

# Methodology:

1. Data Loading
   Imported datasets containing match statistics, goalscorers, results, and shootout details.
   Verified the data integrity and ensured proper formatting.
2. Data Preprocessing
   Cleaned and filtered data specific to Cristiano Ronaldo by isolating relevant columns and entries.
   Handled missing values and categorized variables (e.g., match types, goal timings).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   Performed univariate and bivariate analyses to understand the distribution and relationships in the data.
   Visualized trends using bar charts, pie charts, and line plots.
4. Key Analyses
   Goals by Year: Identified Ronaldo's peak and most consistent years.
   Goals by Match Type: Analyzed his performance in home, away, and neutral matches.
   Goals Timing: Explored when Ronaldo scored most frequently during matches.
   Performance in Tournaments: Evaluated his contributions in various tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro, and others.
   Comparative Analysis: Compared Ronaldo’s career statistics with Lionel Messi to highlight differences.
   Finals Analysis: Examined his impact in finals versus regular matches.
5. Visualization
   Created visual representations such as:
   Goals by year (line plot).
   Goals by timing intervals (bar chart).
   Goals by the tournament (horizontal bar chart).
   Goals by match outcome (pie chart).
   Saved visualizations for easy reference.

# Results & Insights:

1. Peak Year: Ronaldo’s best year was 2019, where he scored 14 goals, with significant contributions in tournaments.
